## Grocery Shopping Strategy: Fresh vs. Frozen

- **Fresh Produce (For Raw Consumption):**
  - Items eaten raw (e.g., leafy greens, cucumbers, jicama, tomatoes, red onions, bell peppers, fresh fruits, ginger) should be purchased fresh.
  
- **Frozen Vegetables (For Cooked Dishes):**
  - For recipes that require steamed or stir-fried vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower, carrots), consider frozen options. They’re flash-frozen at peak ripeness, retain most nutrients, and help reduce waste.
